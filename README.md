JCleanup
========

This tool cleans up a folder, or a list hierarchy of folders by deleting the files in the directory based on the rules set in the `.cleanup` file. 
The format of the file is fairly simple and a basic version of it can be generated by the tool as well.

Usage
-----

`java -jar cleanup.jar -[l|g|h|r] [folderToCleanUp]`

Parameters
----------

`-h  :  Shows help.`

`-g  :  Generates an example of the .cleanup file in the directory set as a parameter.`

`-l  :  Lists the files and doesn't remove anything.`

`-r  :  Recoursively cleanup the folders.`
    
Note: the parameters should be entered separately.

Sample file
-----------

```
# This is a comment. You can use comments in the properties-file manner from Java.
# Uncomment any of the configuration lines to activate the given rule.
#
# The following line is a date cleanup. The only value for a date cleanup, that
# must be set is the amount part, thus falling back to the default behaviour and
# removes files older than the number of days entered.
# The following line removes files accessed more than five days ago.
#type=date 5
#
# The following line is the same as the previous.
#type=date access +5d
#
# This is the regex format of the command: date( create| edit| access)? ([+-]?)([0-9]+)([smhdwMy])?
#
# The second way of deleting files is limiting the amount of files. In that case the
# sorting of the files is done either by the name or by the 'lastModified' value. You
# can also specify the sorting order (default is desc).
#
# The following line limits the number of files in the folder to the newest five.
#type=amount date 5
# The regex of the rule is: amount (name|date)?( asc| desc)? [0-9]+
```
